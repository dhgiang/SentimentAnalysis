Better if Whitewalkers had won and last episode just silence.|objviewer20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is utterly disrespectful Forget all subplots, forget mystery around the White Walkers, forget The Faceless Men, Jon's heritage, forget that there once was logic and common sense in the series. The show lost everything George R.R. Martin created - a complex world of utter fantasy and everyday life with politics, war strategies and basic human needs combined in a beautiful and authentic saga which you wish would never come to an end. And the showrunners did everything in their power to ruin it. What a shame.|Celestialwit20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rushed. Everything is rushed and disappointing, i have no problem with the ending... my problem is how we reached this ending. They massacred the show.|amal-saleh-kc20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How do I rate 0/10? Because it was that bad. Such a disappointment. My expectations were below the ground already, yet this finale still managed to leave me dumbfounded.|nuno-5826520|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Great Disappointment... We left behind a year in which the fans had been waiting a long time, ran from theories to theories, brainstormed and all expectations were destroyed in the 8th season. At some point, I can almost say that I was almost happy to say the series is over. Why does such a series end up so bad? Character development was ignored. Very big disappointment. It would be better if Drogon and Ghost made sex in the final.|ahmetkozan20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I always told myself that no matter how much I hate an episode, it will never deserve an 1/10.|argyroudis_st20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Shame... Shame... Shame... The writers should be forced to walk naked for miles through a crowd of Game of Throne fans before they could make the next Star Wars movie|almir-927-53546420|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Just like Kit Harington said; 'Dissapointing' The expectations were so high, it was almost bound to be dissapointing. Safe to say I was feeling let down after watching this episode.|esmensemihuysal20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The greatest TV show of all time had the worst finale There's a poetic justice to that. if you are considering getting into this show now, save yourself. and now my watch has ended.|ljeezo20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

W- what? Four stars for: the first one for music (it is incredible, hands down) the second one for work behind the camers and for all of the staff that worked hard to create such an experience the third one for the few of the characters which development was huge and they were actually viewable and likeable the fourth one is for the actors, who actually played their roles perfectly (even if the script sucked)|haris-mustajbasic21|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought this would be the show I'd rewatch every year all my life. I'm certain I won't be watching it again, thought the same when S8E3 came out, but I gave the show benefit of the doubt. Now I'm certain. There's no fun rewatching it when you know how disappointing the ending will be. Thank you D&D. To the amazing actors and the rest of the crew: You did an amazing job. Those reviews aren't for you.|marsagishviligig20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Where do I puke? Its left a shell of a show. It has fallen without. GRRM. The conclusion may be what George always wanted, but the execution is beyond repair. D&D, you will never be forgiven.|xo-jb-bhuvi20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This will do down in history As one of the THEY worst endings a tv show could have! Truly terrible and not at all faithful to the Characters|alexanderadair-1159720|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, it's over. I regret ever watching this show. Every moment I spent talking about it, cheering it, every single moment... I wish it never happened. This has been one of the biggest disappointments of my entire life. Now let's hope I can forget this disgrace and go back to regular life.|Lou-Series20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Saddening This is such a sad ending to a great show. This honestly has been the biggest let down in TV history.|gbboy20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Better delete last 3 epizodes Make The long night end of the show. That will be the best decision.|jivkoivanov20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The writers quit!? So the writers didn't want to write the remaining seasons... so they could work on something else??? Ok let's say I understand that, let's find someone else qualified to finish this masterpiece. No? Let's just finish it in one sloppy season, where you can barely recognize any of the characters. DnD should be ashamed of themselves for wasting the time of all the great actors and actresses in this amazing show. Such a shame that this series had to go down in flames. Mad probs to all the actors and actresses, I will never forget you guys and your great work! Hope to see you all in future films, with writers that dont quit on ya :D|wrytoon20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why it sucked In a word RUSHED. When you rush something small plot holes become huge black holes, nice developed character arcs become schizophrenic characters and all your left with is shock for shock sake. Why? selfishness and ego by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, listed as the producers and directors (each season actually has had 4-6 directors) and very inflated script writers (again each season has had several script writers), they D&D are simply just very lucky guys, they are mediocre, of only average not very good script writing ability. They D&D try to take all the credit, when it was ALL the work of the author George R.R. Martin, his books his source material as his five completed novels had been more or less exhausted by end of season 6, and who up to season 4, George R.R. Martin himself was personally involved in script writing and consulting GOT which is why seasons 1-4 were excellent and established the show, and why series 7 and 8 are so bad and why D&D wanted to wrap up GOT at season 7 because they run out of the source material! do you know how bad they D&D depended on the books written by George R.R. Martin a character says a sentence in the books the SAME sentence is said by the human actor in GOT. Come on even the TV title Game of Thrones is the title of one of the 5 books. Did D&D even come up with the idea themselves? maybe overheard someone while in a Starbucks! Anyway, back to being rushed," search online excellent article by Forbes ""It Is Now Clear Having Two Short 'Game Of Thrones' Final Seasons Was A Mistake"" with HBO begging D&D for extra seasons and the author George R.R. Martin quoted as saying ""We could have gone to 11",12," 13 seasons"" (I assume legal contracts stopped HBO from dumping D&D). That's why the rush job", because in truth D&D just got very lucky, they simply did not want to be found out how talentless they are after they run out of the source material by George R.R. Martin! why else walk away from such a successful series according to New York Times, GOT generates more than $1 billion annually. And then Star Wars job offer comes along, to earn D&D millions of dollars on top of the 10's millions they earned from GOT. They wanted to wrap this up as quickly as possible to jump to Disney, probably the delay in GOT final series was them writing the Star Wars script! D&D are a good match for Disney, as Disney creativity has hit low bottom, these talentless hacks will fit right in writing for a children audience. D&D said to themselves Sod GOT, sod the fans, sod the actors, sod the author and sod HBO who wanted more seasons," ""we are off to make Star Wars"" and ruined what was once the best TV show on earth.|kkmeurope20|May 2019 "
"Hope the books tell another story. This is yet another ""Never wrote a review"" review. It is sad what happened here. Can't say anything else but wait for the books", hope for the best.|diogocmoraes20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Remember the show Dexter? This ending is worse. D&D managed to ruin the series after almost a decade of brilliant work. I hope they have their Star Wars trilogy opportunity serious scrutinized after this trainwreck. Ego based moves on the behalf of D&D detracted significantly from the quality of the last season, such that it is hard to recall a worse ending to a series. It is hard to not feel bad for the cast and the rest of the production team, who despite their clear best efforts were clearly left with a irredeemable script. Their performances were great otherwise.|bryceragatz20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Written by 10 year old fan fiction enthusiast This was nothing short of the worst ending to a TV show ever. All That hard work undone by 3 really meh seasons and a really terrible conclusion|benthomasfoster20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bad Horrible writing and this show is just plain awful!|mattgorman-3756520|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I am so sad to rate 1/10 for one of the best series ever I was living and breathing GoT for 6th seasons. Last season was OK, nothing special. Almost two years, we have waited for 8th season. As weeks pass by, each episode is more disappointing than previous. I just wanted perfect ending for amazing series which I loved for 10 years. Extremely disappointed and still focused with this season writing. Just why?|jovanaja20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Theoretically fair end with bad writing|albrechtmeincke20|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the greatest letdowns in history How in the world could Game of Thrones end with nothing but a whimper? All the build up that should have gone into this episode went nowhere. File the majority of this final season in the bin, because it shouldn't have finished like this. Poor George RR. I'm sure the money is great, but this mess was an insult to his hard work.|heatsink9820|May 2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
